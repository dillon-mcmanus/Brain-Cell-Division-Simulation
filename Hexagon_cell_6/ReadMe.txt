To get the code from the github, you'll have to(to the best of my knowledge) copy each file(except this one) in the 'Hexagon_cell_6' folder and put it in a  folder on your computer. Then download Processing with the link in the email.  Then, when in Processing, click File>Open... and go to the folder on your computer with all these files from github. Double click one of them and the files should open on Processing. From there, just click the run button in the top left corner. 

As a reminder, each cell has a small gray square button. If you click this, it will turn dark gray, whcih means the cell has been selected. Now, click any key from 1-6. Each key corresponds to a different type of division. Click 0 to go back one move. 

The large square button in the bottom right corner toggles the visibility of the small square buttons on each cell.
